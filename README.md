<h1 align="center">move.it</h1>

<p>This project made during RocketSeat's NLW#04, using React and TypeScript. It's an application that helps you focus while working, using the Pomodoro technique - and when the timer ends, it suggests an exercise for your body or your eyes, so you can be productive and still take care of your health.</p>
